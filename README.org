#+TITLE: G4LBNE

* Caveat

This repository is a fork/mirror of g4lbne from its CVS repository here:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  :pserver:anonymous@cdcvs.fnal.gov:/cvs/projects/lbne-beamsim
#+END_EXAMPLE

The =master= branch holds the older v2.  A newer [[https://github.com/dune/g4lbne/tree/v3_branch][v3]] is on its own branch.

* Installation

Main prerequisites:

- CMake 2.6
- Geant4 9.5.p01
- ROOT 5.34/36

Newer versions may work but are not tested.

Use CMake to build the package in the usual CMake way.  

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install /path/to/g4lbne
#+END_EXAMPLE

Some build automation is available in [[https://github.com/brettviren/grinst][grinst]]

* Etc

See [[./readme-fnal.txt]] for original readme file which includes FNAL-specific setup, some usage and troubleshooting.
