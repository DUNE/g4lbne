This is an informal, code level, release note:

v3r0 : gemoetry complete, see LBNE doc 7922 for status. 

Sept 23 - 25: 
a. adjust the Z offset for Volume TargetHallAndHorn1 and Hron2Hall such
that the cooredinate MCZERO, drawing 8875.112-MD-363097, updated gy Jim Hylen, 
July 2013, is at Z = 0., G4 world coordinate system. This MCZero is the
"idealize" statring point of Horn1. 

b. Hor1n inner conductor geometry Re-adjust ( again) the ratio of equation 0
to equation 1 weights and cross-check the test ratio compatibility. If the 
geometry is not rescaled, the maximum length of target inside Horn1 is about
62.25 cm 

c. Minor upgrade in the SteepingAction for dumping information about Geantino
tracing. 

d. Installation of the Decay Pipe Snout and Beryllium window (Al frame, Al/Be
window.) And helium in the ~ 10 m. long snout.
