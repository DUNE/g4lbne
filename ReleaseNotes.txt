This is an informal, code level, release note:

v3r0 : gemoetry complete, see LBNE doc 7922 for status. 

Sept 23 - 25: 
a. adjust the Z offset for Volume TargetHallAndHorn1 and Hron2Hall such
that the cooredinate MCZERO, drawing 8875.112-MD-363097, updated gy Jim Hylen, 
July 2013, is at Z = 0., G4 world coordinate system. This MCZero is the
"idealize" statring point of Horn1. 

b. Hor1n inner conductor geometry Re-adjust ( again) the ratio of equation 0
to equation 1 weights and cross-check the test ratio compatibility. If the 
geometry is not rescaled, the maximum length of target inside Horn1 is about
62.25 cm 

c. Minor upgrade in the SteepingAction for dumping information about Geantino
tracing. 

d. Installation of the Decay Pipe Snout and Beryllium window (Al frame, Al/Be
window.) And helium in the ~ 10 m. long snout. 

Sept 26-27:

e. Reinstallation of the Hadron calorimeter. Create a new buffer volume, size to
the 4 individual pieces that were daughter of the TOP volume received from MARS.
This volume (HadronAbsorberTop in G4lbne) is rotate with respect to the decay
pipe axis (beam axis), by the beam angle to reach South Dakota Homestake mine. 
These 4 daughter volumes are placed in HadronAbsorberTop, roated by +90 degree
around the Z axis, as the X-Axis in MARS is the vertical direction.  The volume
named PreM_sp is not centered on the beam line, is presumed to be a supporting
structure, and is indeed at negative Y in g4lbne. 

To be verified with visualization! 

We are not quite done: 

	- the premask entrance volume is currently shifted up by ~20 cm. This
	might be o.k., since the buffer volume is rotated, we'd like to have the
	entrance window shifted up, such the core is more or less centered on
	the beam axis. 

f. Fix severe bug in creating the directions and vertices of the protons 
in LBNEPrimaryGeneratorAction.  Confusion about beam spread in spatial position
vs beam divergence (emittances in x', y', which we currently don't have), caused
creating vertices with Nan... P.L. blurry code, no doubt.. 

Protons of 120 GeV now impinging on target, from a z-coordinate of -3.60, well
upstream of the target. .. 

Oct 1 2014

 Adding 4 corners to the target fins. Install new and improved version of 
 Hadron absorber via new GDML file. Scary error message from the GDML parser,
 and a 73 micron overlap. Need to check with visualization. Meanwhile, geantino
 reached the core of this new absorber, going 
 
 Oct 2 2014 
 
 Start installing the shielding blocks, all made of steel. They include the
 cooling pannels, where the density is a but overestimate, as the cooling tube
 are not yet implemented. Working on it.. But making a cvs commit now ..
 
 Review again the target dimensions, and remove some of the empty space.
